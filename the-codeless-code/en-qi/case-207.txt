Illus.0.title: I used to mix leftover corned-beef hash with flour and yeast to make these *really* tasty saltines.  But when I tried to sell them as "Salted Hash Crackers" I got a visit from the NSA.

[[#206|This same monk]] went to master [[Bawan]] and said:
"Tell me of the monk [[Mudána]], for I am new to the Temple
and have never heard of him, except that he was banished for
laziness."

Bawan replied: "Mudána wished to be a great developer.  He
asked questions of the masters, studied the code of his
peers, and insisted that the team leads review his work."

The monk said: "If all this is true, then surely Mudána was
not lazy."

Bawan rapped the monk's head with his staff.  "[[Eku]] had a
parrot that asked each visitor if Patterns and Antipatterns
were one and the same, yet the only answer the parrot wanted
was a cracker.  The bird memorized random bits of
bibble-babble merely to repeat the sounds.  And it insisted
on performing for Eku because she would sometimes stroke its
head."

The monk rubbed his head, saying: "Yet you said that Mudána
wished to be a great developer!"

Bawan replied: "Eku's parrot wished to be like its master.
Did it yearn to possess Eku's wisdom... or her ability to open the
cabinet where the crackers were kept?"
