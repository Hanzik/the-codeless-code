[[#215|This same monk]] continued to assist users of the
toolkit he had authored.  But after another unproductive
week spent answering their questions he reached
the end of his patience, and again complained to his fellows.

"Perhaps [[Landhwa]] of the [[Spider Clan]] can advise you,"
suggested one.  "His talent for avoiding tedious work is
legendary throughout the Temple; for although there have
been lazier monks than he, none have managed to keep their
heads attached."

So the monk messaged Landhwa, described his problem,
and asked his advice.

An hour later, the monk received a reply on his screen:

<em>Of all the users of your toolkit,</em> it began, <em>who
is the most stubbornly proud of his own intellect?  Who
would rather take a hundred blows than admit one gap in
their knowledge of any subject?</em>

The monk thought for a moment, then typed,
<em>Kew Niao, certainly.</em>

<em>Very well,</em> came the reply. <em>Whenever you receive
an unwanted question, say that you are indisposed at the
moment, and have the sender consult Kew Niao.</em>

The monk frowned. <em>I will still find that bothersome,</em> he typed.

<em>In that case,</em> came the reply, <em>configure your
account so that questions with particular keywords
are quietly forwarded to Kew Niao, with neither party the
wiser.</em>

<em>Excellent!</em> typed the monk. <em>How is this done?</em>

<em>Sadly, I must confess that I do not know,</em> came the reply.
<em>But I am absolutely CERTAIN that LANDHWA knows.</em>
