<i>As most of the Temple is away for the mid-winter
holidays, there has been little news to report.  But since
some of you have expressed interest in the doings of our
peers in the exotic Far West, I recruited the nun [[Yíwen]]
to prepare an edifying monograph on that subject.</i>

<i>I asked her to describe the conditions under which a
developer in those strange lands might be judged as
unsatisfactory.  Sadly, I see that -- yet again -- she has
answered my earnest request with amphigory.  My most solemn
apologies. -- Qi.</i>
