Illus.0.title: Changing the name "cache invalidation" would require that we all unlearn the existing name for the concept -- which is a form of cache invalidation.

A junior monk said to master [[Kaimu]]: One of the
Patriarchs claimed that there are "only two hard things" in
our craft.  What are these "two hard things"?

Kaimu answered: You only need to remember that the first
hard thing is called "cache invalidation".

The junior monk asked: Does that mean that a /whole/ cache
is made invalid, or just some of its elements?  And why call
it "invalidation" when the only error is that the data is stale?
Wouldn't "cache element expiration" be a better name?

Kaimu answered: Now you know the second hard thing.
